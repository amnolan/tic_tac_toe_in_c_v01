This app is an implementation of Tic Tac Toe in C. It has been tested on *nix type systems but not on a Windows machine.

You will likely have compilation or runtime issues if you are building on a Windows machine and may need to remove references to -nix specific header files and methods related to those headers.

Please check the wiki for more information.
